### Objective Questions

1.	How has average salary in the data science field changed from 2020 to 2024 and what is expected for future trends?
   
2.	How do salary levels vary across different job roles?
   
3.	Is there a correlation between the work arrangement and the salary of individuals in the data science field?
   
4.	How does the size of a company (small, medium, large) correlate with the salaries of data science professionals?
   
5.	Are there geographic salary variations for data science roles based on company location?

## Methodology

**Data Cleaning and Transformation**: No cleaning was required. Abbreviated columns were replaced with their full values and the appropriate data types were used.

**Salary forecast**: A forecast sheet was created to illustrate salary trends over the next five years.

## Key findings

1.	There is a slight decrease in salary in 2021, a significant increase in 2022, and a steady rise until 2023, followed by a slight decrease in 2024. Forecasted salaries from 2025 to 2029 show consistent annual growth, indicating a positive outlook for increases. 

2.	- Leadership roles like "Head of Machine Learning" and "Managing Director Data Science" boast salaries surpassing $250,000 annually, indicating lucrative compensation for leadership positions.

    - Specialized roles such as "Cloud Data Architect", "AWS Data Architect", and "Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer" command higher-than-average salaries.

    - Also, roles like "Data Scientist", "Machine Learning Engineer", and "Data Engineer" consistently rank among the highest-paying positions.

3.	On-site work commands the highest average salary at $154,094 annually, followed by remote work at $145,414 annually, and hybrid work at $81,840 annually. 

4.	Medium-sized companies offer the highest average salary at $151,706 annually, followed by large companies at $139,295 annually, and small companies at $87,174 annually.

5.	High salaries are found in countries like the Quatar, Israel, US, New Zealand, and Canada.

## Considerations for Job Seekers/Professionals.

1.	Given the anticipated growth in salaries, job seekers can prioritize honing skills that align with high-demand areas such as data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing.

2.	Job seekers should consider honing their skills in high-demand areas such as data analysis, machine learning, and cloud computing.

3.	Job seekers should carefully consider their preferred work arrangements and how they align with their career goals, lifestyle preferences, and financial needs. While on-site roles may offer higher salaries, in-person mentorship for those seeking specialized training, remote and hybrid roles provide flexibility and autonomy.

4.	Job seekers should balance salary with non-monetary factors like company culture, work-life balance, and skill development when assessing job offers. Medium-sized firms offer good pay and growth potential, while small and large companies provide unique benefits suiting individual preferences and career goals.

5.	Regions with higher salaries may also offer better professional development opportunities, networking events, and access to industry leaders. However, a higher salary in one region may not necessarily translate to a higher standard of living. Therefore, professionals should conduct a cost-of-living analysis when evaluating job opportunities.
